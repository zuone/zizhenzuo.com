    <p>I'm Zuo Zizhen, a designer form China.
        I had the opportunity to practice at Accenture, which enabled me to maintain good working habits. After graduation, I joined a start-up company, so I have more opportunities to achieve bold design. My goal is to be an independent developer, I am good at integrating my various skills together to play out more power, such as design, code and 3D animation.</p>
