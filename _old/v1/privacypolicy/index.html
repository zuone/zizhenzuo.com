    Share, Re-post & Settings: Our Services are primarily designed to help you share your Instagram’s albums with the world. Most of the information you provide us is information you are asking us to make public.

We may use this information to customize the content we show you, including advertisements or our promotions. Our default setting is almost always to make the information you provide public for as long as you do not delete it from Grab for Instagram, but we generally give you settings to make the information more private if you want. Our Services broadly and instantly disseminate your public information to a wide range of users, customers, and services. When you share information or content like photos, videos, and links via the Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public.<br>
